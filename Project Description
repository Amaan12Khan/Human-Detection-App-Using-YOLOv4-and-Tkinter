Human Detection App Using YOLOv4 and Tkinter
Overview
This project is a Python-based human detection application that uses the YOLOv4 object detection model to count the number of people in an image. The application provides a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) using Tkinter, where users can upload an image, and the app will detect and count the number of humans present.

Key Features
✅ Uses YOLOv4, a state-of-the-art object detection model.
✅ Loads images through a user-friendly Tkinter GUI.
✅ Detects humans in images and counts them.
✅ Displays the image with detections in the GUI.
✅ Implements Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to eliminate redundant detections.

How It Works
User Uploads an Image – The Tkinter GUI allows users to select an image file.
Image Preprocessing – The image is resized and converted into a blob for YOLO processing.
YOLOv4 Detection
The model loads pre-trained weights (yolov4.weights) and config (yolov4.cfg).
It uses the COCO dataset, which includes humans as a category.
The image is analyzed, and bounding boxes are generated around detected objects.
Filtering for Humans
The detections are filtered to include only "person" (Class ID 0 in COCO).
Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) removes overlapping bounding boxes.
Displaying Results
The detected count is shown in the GUI.
The processed image is displayed in the Tkinter window.
